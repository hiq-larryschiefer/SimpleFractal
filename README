Simple Android application for generating fractals.  At this time only Mandelbrot fractals
are supported.

Use volume up/down to change the generator in use.

Timing data is ELAPSED time, not EXECUTION time.  Logged as well as printed via Toast.

STILL NEEDED:
- zoom in/out 
- configuration settings for #iterations, default zoom
- Native generator implementation
- Multi-threaded Java implementation
- Multi-threaded native generator
